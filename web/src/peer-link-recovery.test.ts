// Peer link recovery without a re-join (#140): when the lobby client recovers a guest's
// link to the host in place (an ICE restart or a transient `disconnected`; no
// `participant-disconnected`, no new `peer-ready`), the host keeps the same player. Held
// input the guest tried to send during the outage was lost, so after the recovery the
// guest re-asserts the guard it actually holds, as after a re-join (#92 / #138): a key
// released during the outage leaves the host's guard lowered, a key held stays raised.
//
// The recovery is driven through the event surface of the pinned upstream lobby client
// (`web/resilient-lobby-session.ts` at the setup-service revision named in
// docs/ARCHITECTURE.md): every `RTCPeerConnection` state change emits
// `peer-statechange` `{ peerId, state }`, ICE-restart recovery emits `peer-recovery`, and
// `peer-ready` is emitted only once per link, so an in-place recovery never re-emits it.
// `sendReliable` throws "Peer … is not ready" while the connection state is not
// `connected`. Only the lobby transport and the host authority are modelled; the client
// runtime and the peer admission boundary are real.
