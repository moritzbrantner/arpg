// Held input survives a lost dedicated datagram without a reconnect (#139). Dedicated
// commands travel as unreliable WebTransport datagrams. When exactly one held-state change
// (guard, movement, aim or bow draw) is lost and the player then does nothing more, the
// dedicated authority must still converge on what the player currently holds within a
// bounded time, on the same connection, without replaying stale values or one-shot actions.
//
// Acceptance contract, independent of the mechanism (periodic re-assertion of the held set,
// a reliable lane for held-state changes, …):
//
// - The seam is the real client runtime with a modelled dedicated session. `sendCommand` is
//   the datagram lane: the test loses exactly one chosen datagram (the write still resolves,
//   as a queued datagram write does). Any other `send*` method an implementation adds to the
//   session for (sequence, payload) commands is modelled as a reliable lane and delivered.
// - Time is fake and injected (`setInterval`, timers, `Date`, `performance`); the authority
//   keeps streaming snapshots at its 60 Hz tick rate, as a live dedicated server does.
// - The authority models `MatchRuntime`: it applies only sequences above its watermark and
//   treats a repeated held value (e.g. a repeated `setGuard` raise or `drawBow`) as a
//   continued hold, as `arpg-core` does.
//
// Bound: CONVERGENCE_BOUND_MS = 500 ms (30 ticks at 60 Hz). A guard stuck raised or a
// character walking on after release for longer than half a second is a gameplay-visible
// desync (blocks taken or missed, positions drifting), while 500 ms leaves room for any
// sensible re-assertion period or a reliable retransmission over a real round trip.
// Traffic bound: COMMANDS_PER_SECOND_PER_INPUT = 10 for each of the HELD_INPUTS = 4 held
// inputs (guard, movement, aim, bow draw), i.e. at most 40 commands per second in total.
// With nothing lost the runtime may re-assert the current held set (even the empty one,
// while idle), but convergence must not be bought by re-sending every input every 60 Hz
// tick (240 per second): a 10 Hz re-assertion of each input already fits the 500 ms bound.
// Idle with nothing held and a steady held set are both checked over 5 s.
