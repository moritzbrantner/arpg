# arpg

Architecture-first action RPG foundation inspired by the systemic shape of Diablo II, built as an original implementation.

The MVP is intentionally an **integration proof**: gameplay truth lives in one deterministic Rust simulation and the renderer, browser UI, peer networking, and dedicated-server runtime consume that authority rather than replacing it.

## Playable MVP

The browser slice currently proves:

- WASD top-down movement with diagonal normalization;
- a procedurally partitioned, seeded dungeon whose walls and doorways are resolved by `physics-engine`;
- an isometric follow camera and simple 3D scene rendered through `3d-lab`;
- nearby primary attacks against deterministic monster state;
- deterministic character progression exposed through authoritative snapshots;
- a deterministic combat training arena available through the character screen or `?scenario=training&seed=<u32>`, with pause, single-step, explicit simulation speed, seed restart, and live combat diagnostics;
- a settings menu with graphics controls and the reusable `input-bindings` keybinding editor;
- local Rust/Wasm play;
- versioned Rust-authoritative savestates with browser quick-save/load and portable JSON import/export;
- one fresh 32-bit run seed per new authority, carried in authoritative snapshots so multiplayer and replay evidence identify the exact generated dungeon;
- host-authoritative peer co-op using `multiplayer-setup-service` for rendezvous and direct WebRTC data channels for commands/snapshots;
- dedicated online play over the shared `game-server` WebTransport protocol, with browser-side framing and snapshot-hash verification but no duplicated gameplay rules;
- the same `ArpgGame` exercised through `game-server::MatchRuntime`, with an equivalence test requiring the dedicated-runtime and direct-local paths to produce the same typed snapshot for the same input stream;
- a runnable TLS/WebTransport dedicated server using the shared `game-server` transport, reconnect, recovery, tick, and shutdown machinery;
- GitHub Pages build/deployment for browser acceptance.

This is deliberately not yet a content-complete ARPG. The slice exists to prove the foundations before inventory, loot, skills, richer AI, assets, character persistence, or larger levels are built on top.

The next product foundation is the **mechanical game loop**: locomotion, action timing, targeting, hit/reaction semantics, pickup/reward interaction, and the one-way presentation cue boundary. These mechanics are treated as reusable ARPG domain contracts rather than late polish or per-skill/per-monster special cases. See [the roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md).

## Foundation ownership

| Concern | Authority |
| --- | --- |
| ARPG rules, player intent, monsters, combat state | `arpg-core` |
| Collision and physical movement | `physics-engine` |
| Scene rendering and renderer contract | `3d-lab` |
| Runtime input semantics and rebinding UI | `input-bindings` |
| Game command/snapshot encoding | `arpg-protocol` |
| Peer rendezvous/signaling | `multiplayer-setup-service` |
| Dedicated sessions, ticks, reconnect, replay/recovery | `game-server` |
| Browser composition/HUD/settings | `web` |

Savestate semantics also live in `arpg-core`: the browser only persists or transfers the versioned save document and asks Rust to validate and restore it. Neither renderer nor network transport is a source of gameplay truth.

## Execution modes

- **Local** — the browser runs `arpg-core` through `arpg-web-wasm`.
- **Peer-hosted co-op** — one browser runs that same Rust/Wasm authority; guests submit sequenced commands and consume host snapshots. `multiplayer-setup-service` remains payload-opaque setup infrastructure.
- **Dedicated online** — the browser connects directly to the runnable `arpg-game-server` WebTransport endpoint. `game-server` owns admission, ticks, reconnect identity, recovery, and transport framing; the browser submits versioned `arpg-protocol` command payloads and renders verified authoritative snapshots.

Peer-hosted co-op is a convenience/trust mode, not an anti-cheat boundary. The host can cheat. Dedicated play is the trusted authority model.

Every new local or peer-hosted authority receives a fresh browser-generated run seed. Guests do not generate an alternate seed: they receive the host's seed as part of the authoritative snapshot. For deterministic local reproduction, open the browser with `?seed=<u32>`; starting another local game afterward intentionally creates a fresh seed. Dedicated runs receive the server-selected seed through authoritative snapshots.

## Run locally

Rust validation:

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --locked --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked --workspace --all-features
```

Browser shell:

```sh
cargo install wasm-pack --locked --version 0.13.1
cd web
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run setup
bun run dev
```

Browser validation after setup:

```sh
bun run format:check
bun run lint
bun run test
bun run build
bun run test:physics-wasm
bunx playwright install chromium
bun run test:browser
```

Formatting writes are explicit through `bun run format`. Browser tests start their
own local servers on OS-allocated ports, use the actual WASM game, and retain
failure traces under ignored `web/test-results/`.

`bun run setup` acquires the accepted browser sources from `input-bindings` and `multiplayer-setup-service`, verifies their exact Git blob hashes, and builds the Rust/Wasm package. Verified foundation files are reused without downloads or rewrites. After setup, `bun run build` bundles locally with Vite and `bun run dev` starts Vite without downloading sources. Run `bun run wasm` again after Rust changes. Generated vendored sources and Wasm output are not committed.

For peer co-op, enter `https://moenarch.com` in **Settings → Peer co-op**, or run a separate `multiplayer-setup-service` deployment. Local development defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8787`. GitHub Pages requires an HTTPS/WSS deployment whose `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` includes the ARPG Pages origin. Hosts and guests fetch short-lived TURN credentials after lobby admission and refresh them in memory before expiry. The upstream client uses TURN during recovery when direct connectivity fails; deployments without TURN still permit direct connections.

Dedicated server:

```sh
ARPG_SERVER_CERT_PEM=cert.pem \
ARPG_SERVER_KEY_PEM=key.pem \
cargo run -p arpg-game-server --bin server
```

The dedicated host defaults to UDP port `4433` and session path `/arpg`. Optional configuration is available through `ARPG_SERVER_PORT`, `ARPG_SERVER_SESSION_PATH`, `ARPG_SERVER_RECOVERY_PATH`, and `ARPG_SERVER_DRAIN_GRACE_MS`. See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for the environment contract; export these variables into the server process because the native server does not load dotenv files. Keep local configuration, certificates, private keys, and recovery data uncommitted. A fresh run seed is generated once when the process starts and logged for replay evidence; set `ARPG_RUN_SEED=<u32>` to reproduce a known run exactly. In a browser with WebTransport support, enter the resulting HTTPS endpoint (for example `https://127.0.0.1:4433/arpg`) under **Settings → Dedicated online**. The certificate must be trusted by the browser.
