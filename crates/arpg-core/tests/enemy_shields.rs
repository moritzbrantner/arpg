//! Acceptance for enemy shield users (#92, "enemy shield users" slice).
//!
//! Contract: a shielded defender (`monster.defender`, the roadmap's "shielded defender"
//! role) raises a guard. Its guard follows the same rules as the player's shield guard:
//! it rises over the shared `guard.raiseTicks` before it protects, a raised guard protects
//! only the front sector against blockable strikes, each block spends the strike's
//! authored guard cost, a strike whose cost reaches the remaining guard breaks it, and a
//! broken guard stays down for the shared `guard.breakTicks`. Its AI decides when to guard
//! deterministically: it closes on its target under a raised guard and lowers the guard
//! only to commit to its own attack. The monster snapshot publishes the guard so
//! presentation can show it.
//!
//! The defender faces its engaged target, so "front" is the side of its target.
//!
//! Tests use only the public runtime: generated dungeons, commands, ticks, snapshots and
//! (validated) save states, which place players and the defender exactly.
