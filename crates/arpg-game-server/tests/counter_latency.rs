//! Counter window under remote latency (#131): peer-hosted and dedicated evidence.
//!
//! A successful block grants a counter opportunity whose eligibility is the half-open
//! interval `[usable_from_tick, expires_at_tick)`, compared with the tick at which the
//! authority *applies* a command. Neither topology compensates for latency: a command
//! counts at the tick it is applied, and carries no tick of its own. These tests drive both
//! authorities through their public seams with the real ARPG wire encoding:
//!
//! - peer-hosted: the host browser's `ArpgGame` (as `arpg-web-wasm` drives it), applying a
//!   guest command when it arrives on the reliable ordered channel;
//! - dedicated: `game_server::MatchRuntime` over [`GameServerAdapter`], admitting sessions
//!   and receiving commands as realtime datagrams (which may be reordered or duplicated).
//!
//! The remote player sees the snapshot that carries the opportunity one-way delay `d`
//! after the authority published it, reacts `r` ticks later, and its command reaches the
//! authority `d` later again: it is applied at `usable_from_tick + 2d + r`. Snapshots are
//! published every tick in both topologies, so there is no further cadence quantization.
